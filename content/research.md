[Using Customer Service to Build Clients’ Trust][jie]<br> 
with Yuk-fai Fong, Ting Liu and Xiaoxuan Meng<br> 
*Journal of Industrial Economics*, Vol. 68, March 2020.<br>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>It is well known in the credence-good literature that in an expert-client relationship, under the Liability assumptions, clients have to reject the expert’s serious-treatment recommendations with a positive probability to ensure that the expert honestly recommends treatments. Inefficiency arises because some socially efficient treatments are not provided. We show that the expert can enhance clients’ trust, or acceptance rate of the serious treatment, by providing intrinsically socially inefficient customer service upon recommending the serious treatment. Enhanced clients’ trust leads to higher efficiency and higher profit for the expert. However, trust cannot be enhanced by providing customer service with different timing.</p>

[Principal-induced Stubbornness in Experts][stubborn]<br>
with Yuk-fai Fong, Xiaoxuan Meng and Kirill Novoselov<br>
[[Online Appendix][online]]<br>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>A principal hires an expert to collect information and then
make a decision,
utilizing both the expert’s private information and informative public opinion.
The optimal contract induces the expert to sometimes defy public opinion even when public opinion is more informative than his private information. 
Our finding is robust to allowing for
switching the arrival times of different signals,
expert reporting his private information,
expert's reputational concern and
repeated interactions.</p>

[Cognition and Product Customization](http://ssrn.com/abstract=4171048)<br>
with Zhengqing Gui
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>We call a product <em>customizable</em> if some of its attributes can be adjusted by buyers after purchase.
In this paper, we study a market in which the seller(s) exerts cognitive efforts to find the optimal product design, and retains the option to make the product customizable for buyers to adjust ex-post.
We fully characterize pure-strategy equilibria for different market structures and show that mild competition fosters seller cognition, increases buyer surplus, and improves social welfare, while excessive competition can be harmful to buyers.
Among other extensions, we also find that government subsidies should target sellers with more effective cognitive technologies.</p>

[The Optimality of (Stochastic) Veto Delegation][paper-veto]<br>
with Haoran Lei
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>We (re-)examine the optimal delegation problem between a principal and an agent, assuming that the latter has state-independent preferences. In this setting, the widely-studied interval delegation fails to elicit the agent's private information. We show that we can restrict attention to stochastic veto mechanisms in searching for a principal's preferred mechanism. When the optimal veto mechanism is valuable, the principal approves all proposals below some threshold and the veto probability increases as the proposed option gets more extreme. Our result provides grounds for the veto delegation pervasive in various organizations.</p>

Voluntarily Separable Game With In-relationship Search<br> 
with Yuk-fai Fong <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>We consider a large society where players can search for a
match at a cost.
The matched pairs play the repeated prisoners’ dilemma game subject to voluntary separation. 
Moreover, players can search for an alternative partner 
while in a relationship.
We find that when the search cost is moderate,
the option to perform in-relationship search, 
while not being exercised on the equilibrium path, 
promotes cooperation and makes the relationship long-lasting.

Label the Divorced: A Repeated-Game Analysis on (Re)Marriage Market With Community Enforcement<br>
with Yuk-fai Fong, Xiaoxuan Meng and Yimeng Zhang
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>We study the marriage and remarriage market in a repeated-game framework with potentially alternating partners. We show that compared with a label-less society, introducing marital labels by a credible institution can i) identify the innocent bachelor(ette)s, and ii) effectively replace inefficient trust-building phase by efficient transfer punishment, therefore achieving welfare improvement. With the presence of marital labels, the socially optimal matching protocol is to arrange as many bachelor-divorced marriages as possible. We also characterize equilibrium behavior for a decentralized society where marital status is either observable or unobservable at dating stage and derive the conditions under which different institution outperforms others.</p>

Credence Goods Markets With Full Choice Right<br>
with Haoran Lei
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>We study the credence goods markets in which an expert seller sends a cheap-talk message to a customer, and then the customer self-selects the most desired option.
Utilizing the quasiconcave envelope approach (Lipnowski and Ravid, 2020), we characterize the expert's expected payoffs and strategies in equilibria.
We extend our model to discuss the effects of customer heterogeneities and
market segmentations. </p>

Verifiability and Fraud in a Dynamic Credence Goods Market<br>
with Jialiang Lin  
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Complementary to the existing literature that extensively studied credence goods markets in static settings, we develop a dynamic model in which a durable good breaks down stochastically after treatments, and the customer meets the expert recurrently. We assume that the minor treatment alleviates the symptom of the major problem but fails to cure it, increasing the future failure rate. In contrast to the literature, we show that the truth-telling equilibrium never exists under the verifiability assumption, because the standard equal-margin condition fails.</p>
 <p>
In our dynamic setting, the expert has a stronger incentive to undertreat since undertreatment induces more future business. But on the other hand, the customer becomes less willing to pay for the minor treatment for fear of increased future payments. Therefore, depending on the relative magnitude of these two opposing forces, either Undertreatment or Overtreatment can emerge in equilibrium. Surprisingly, the expert’s incentive to undertreat weakens as the increment of failure rates rises.</p>
